# TodoVoodoo Project - Learning Conventions

## Project Overview

A React todo list learning project for a beginner frontend developer.

## User Profile

- **JavaScript Level**: Basic knowledge
- **React Experience**: Only dabbled with personal projects
- **Dev Tools**: Basic understanding of modern development tools
- **Learning Style**: Learn by doing with guidance

## Our Learning Conventions

### 1. Explanation-First Approach

- Assistant explains concepts, patterns, and reasoning before implementation
- Complex tasks broken down into smaller, manageable steps
- Focus on _why_ we're doing something, not just _what_ to do

### 2. User Implementation Responsibility

- User writes the code based on explanations and guidance
- Assistant reviews code and provides feedback
- Assistant only writes code directly if user is completely stuck after multiple attempts

### 3. Question & Clarification Protocol

- User should ask questions whenever something isn't clear
- User shares current understanding so assistant can correct misconceptions
- User communicates comfort level with each concept (beginner/familiar/confident)

### 4. Code Review Process

- User shares code after implementing each step
- Assistant provides specific feedback on improvements, best practices, and React patterns
- Discuss alternative approaches when relevant

### 5. Learning Checkpoints

- After each major feature, review what was learned
- Assistant suggests related concepts to explore
- Revisit and refactor earlier code as skills improve

### 6. Debugging Together

- When encountering errors, user shares error message and attempted solution
- Assistant guides through debugging process rather than just giving the fix
- Discuss how to prevent similar issues

## Project Goals

- Build a functional todo list application
- Learn React fundamentals through hands-on practice
- Understand modern React patterns and best practices
- Develop debugging and problem-solving skills
