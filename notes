Step 1: Create Filtered Data
Where: In your App component, after your state declarations but before the JSX return
What: Create a new array of tasks based on the current activeFilter
Think about: What JavaScript array method creates a new array based on conditions?

Step 2: Define Filter Logic
For each filter type, think about:
"all": Which tasks should show? (probably all of them)
"today": How do you check if a task's dueDate is today?
"7days": How do you check if a task is due within 7 days?

Step 3: Use Filtered Data in Render
What: Instead of using tasks in your .map(), use your filtered array
Where: In your JSX where you currently have {tasks.map(...)}

Key Questions to Guide You:
Where should the filtering logic go? (During render, before JSX)
How do you compare dates in JavaScript?
What happens when activeFilter changes? (Component re-renders, filtering logic runs again)
Your mission: Head to VSCode and tackle creating that filtered array!
